instruction:
  name: "c.addi"
  long_name: "Add a sign-extended non-zero immediate"
  description: |
    C.ADDI adds the non-zero sign-extended 6-bit immediate to the value in register xd then writes the result to xd.
    C.ADDI expands into `addi xd, xd, imm`.
    C.ADDI is only valid when xd &ne; x0 and imm &ne; 0.
    The code points with xd=x0 encode the C.NOP instruction; the remaining code points with imm=0 encode HINTs.

  assembly: "xd, imm"
  match: "000-----------01"
